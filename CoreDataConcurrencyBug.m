In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with `NSManagedObjectContext` and its lifecycle, particularly in scenarios involving background threads or asynchronous operations.  The error manifests as seemingly random crashes or unexpected behavior related to Core Data. This is often due to incorrect usage of context's save, merge, and concurrency mechanisms. For instance, attempting to save a context on a thread other than the one it was created on can lead to crashes. Similarly, if you are working with a child context, making changes in a child context and then trying to access/update data on the parent context without proper merging can cause data inconsistency.
